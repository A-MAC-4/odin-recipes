<h2>Pre project</h2> 

<p>This project is a review on HTML and a way to put what I have learned into practice. I am excited to be doing my first project. Once complete, I will do a summary - see below.</P>

<h2>Post project</h2>

<p>This project was a review on the first html section of the odin project. I put into practice my knowledge of the boilerplate, anchoring links, adding images, linking to external sites and within my own site. The hardest part of this project was honestly the commits and commit messages. I think I need more practice on that.</p>
