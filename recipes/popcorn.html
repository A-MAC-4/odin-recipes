 <h2> Why Should I Make This?</h2>
    <p>Popcorn is my favorite, and this sweet and salty popcorn is a must have for a  weekend movie snack! I stole this from
         <a href="https://www.sweetestmenu.com/sweet-and-salty-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel= noopener noreferrer></a>this site.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup popping corn</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons caster sugar</li>
    <li>Sea salt</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Add oil to large saucepan and heat on medium high.
        Drop in a kernel or two and see if it spins. Once it spins, the oil is ready to go. 
        Pour in half a cup of popping corn and 3 heaps tablespoons of caster sugar, give it a quick stir and put on the lid. 
        Occasionally give the saucepan a good shake and let the corn pop away.</li>
    <li>When the popping starts to subside, remove from heat and leave it for a few seconds for the last few to pop. 
        Its better to remove it from the heat early, otherwise it may burn. 
        Pour into a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt.</li>
 </ol>
